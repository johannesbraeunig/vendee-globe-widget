A widget to show a team/skipper on e.g. the iOS homescreen. Data is being scraped on a regular basis.

The following parameters need to be configured at the top of the widget:

```ts
const API_URL = "";
const API_ID = "";
const API_TOKEN = "";
```

The skipper/team can be set by the skippers name, e.g. "Boris Herrmann", as parameter from the Scriptable.app. The list of names can be found here: https://vendee-globe.fly.dev/

## API Access

The API is not public. Drop me a message in case you would like to have access.

## Notes

It's a private project. Nothing I can guarantee! :D
